# HEYO!

I'm Brandon, an upcoming full-stack software developer.

---

### What I'm Most Interested In

Full-Stack Web Development - I'm fascinated by the fact that I can type funny words into a file and force computers to obey my commands... Pfffffffft I mean, I love coding! 😉

---

### My Goals

⚒️ **1:** Be fluent in this tech stuff;

~ **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** ✅ (2022-2023)  
~ **React.js (Vite)** ⚒️ (1/16/2024 - Finished first real project using React + Vite 😎👉 https://github.com/BrandonMartinDev/Finanza-JS)  
~ **TypeScript** ⚒️  
~ **Sass/Scss** ⚒️  
~ **Node.js** ⚒️  
~ **SQL/NoSQL**  
~ **Next.js**  
~ **C#**  
~ **Blazor** or **ASP.NET**  

**2:** Secure a good job 

**3:** Be that one programmer on a beach, in a foreign country, working remote, and doing my passion... Doesn't everyone going into tech wish this huh?

**4:** When I got nothing else to do, maybe I'll teach myself these;

~ **C** - Isn't it like the mother of most programming languages?
~ **C++** - Yeahhhhh, there's a reason why it's not one of my main goals lol...
~ **Assembly...** - Probably makes C++ look like python

### What I'm Currently Fluent In

~ **LUA/LUAU** - I actually began my coding career when I started teaching myself to program thanks to ROBLOX when I was 14/15 years old... Yes, the kid's game platform. Surprisingly, it taught me alot of the core concepts of programming!

~ **HTML/CSS/Javascript** - Ok ok, I know it's nothing special but everyone had to learn it at one point right?

### Wanna Contact Me?

First of all why? I'm not even ready for a job... Yet

**Portfolio Link:** *Not yet, I'll get put it here when it's finished*  
**Email:** Haha, nope.. Maybe later.
