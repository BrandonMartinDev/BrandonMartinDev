**2:** Secure a good job 

**3:** Be that one programmer on a beach, in a foreign country, working remote, and doing my passion... Doesn't everyone going into tech wish this huh?

**4:** When I got nothing else to do, maybe I'll teach myself these;

- *C* - Isn't it like the mother of most programming languages?  
- *C++* - Yeahhhhh, there's a reason why it's not one of my main goals lol...  
- *Assembly...* - Probably makes C++ look like python

### What I'm Currently Fluent In

- **LUA/LUAU** - I actually began my coding career when I started teaching myself to program thanks to ROBLOX when I was 14/15 years old... Yes, the kid's game platform. Surprisingly, it taught me alot of the core concepts of programming!

- **HTML/CSS/Javascript** - Ok ok, I know it's nothing special but everyone had to learn it at one point right?
